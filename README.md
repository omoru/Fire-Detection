# Fire-Detection
 
## Detecting fire using different techniques of computer vision:

    1 -  Classification + localization on images fine-tuning a VGG model.

    2 -  Classification + localization on images fine-tuning a Vision Transformer model.(in progress)

    3 -  Classification + localization on video fine-tuning a Vision Transformer model.(in progress)
