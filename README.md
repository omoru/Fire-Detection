## Detecting fire using different techniques of computer vision:

    1 -  Classification + localization on images training a CNN from scratch.

    2 -  Classification + localization on images by transfer learning and fine-tuning ResNet50.

    3 -  Classification + localization on images training a Vision Transformer model for visualize attention.  (** in progress **)
    
    4 -  Object Detection on videos by transfer learning and fine-tuning a Detection Transformer.  (** in progress **)
    
    5 -  Object Detection on videos by transfer learning and fine-tuning a YOLO (ou only look once) model.  (** in progress **)
